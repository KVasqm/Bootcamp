# Bootcamp
This is my final project for data analyst Jr bootcamp.
Real-life taxi data from New York City will be used to conduct a comprehensive analysis, since data collection and storage to insight extraction and visual presentation.

Data came from the official Website NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission: https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page
